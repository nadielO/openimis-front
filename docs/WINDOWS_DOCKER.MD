# openIMIS Frontend Reference Implementation : Windows Docker

This repository holds the configuration files for the openIMIS Frontend Reference Implementation:

- Legacy web application
- Modular front end

Please look for the direction on the openIMIS Wiki: https://openimis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/963182705/MO1.1+Install+the+modular+openIMIS+using+Docker

Note: the modular frontend is part of the release ZIP of the legacy webapp, if the modular frontend need to be changed then new modular frontend static files need to be placed in /inetroot/www/openIMIS/front

Note 2: The docker file can be change to build first the frontend by uncommenting the "downloader" related lines.

This repo branches, tags,... are maintained by openIMIS official delivery team who use it to build the official openIMIS Docker images containing the official modules (versions) list.

In case of troubles, please consult/contact our service desk via our [ticketing site](https://openimis.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer).
